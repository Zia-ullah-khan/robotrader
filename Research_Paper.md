### 3.4 LLM Integration

The system integrates GPT-3.5 for trading decision generation:

#### 3.4.1 Prompt Engineering

The system employs sophisticated prompt engineering to generate contextual trading decisions through GPT-3.5. The LLM integration consists of two main components:

**System Configuration:**
```python
# OpenAI API Configuration
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

def llm(accountInfo, stockData, prompt, volatility):
    """Call the OpenAI API with the provided account info, stock data, and prompt."""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a financial advisor."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Account Info: {accountInfo}\nStock Data: {stockData}\nPrompt: {prompt}"}
        ],
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

**Trading Strategy Prompt Template:**
The core prompt template used for generating trading decisions integrates multiple data sources:

```python
# Dynamic Trading Prompt Generation
prompt = f"""Based on the current market conditions and the predicted volatility, 
what would be a good trading strategy for {symbol}? 

Return a JSON object with the following structure:
- 'action': (buy/sell/hold)
- 'reason': (detailed explanation for the decision)
- 'amount': (number of shares, not dollar amount)
- 'notion': (additional trading insights)
- 'type': (market, limit, stop, stop_limit, trailing_stop)
- 'time_in_force': (day, gtc, opg, cls, ioc, fok)

Consider the following factors:
1. Current account status and available balance
2. Predicted volatility: {volatility}
3. Historical market data and technical indicators
4. Risk management: ensure shares * current stock price ≤ available balance
5. Stock's typical price range for appropriate share amounts

Account Information: {account_info}
Stock Data: {stock_data}
Predicted Volatility: {volatility}"""
```

**Input Data Structure:**
The prompt receives contextual information in the following format:
- **Account Information**: Available balance, current positions, account status
- **Stock Data**: Historical price data, technical indicators, volatility predictions
- **Market Context**: Current market conditions and relevant financial metrics

**Response Processing:**
The system includes robust response parsing to handle LLM output:

```python
# Response Parsing and Error Handling
try:
    if isinstance(response, str):
        start = response.find('{')
        end = response.rfind('}') + 1
        if start != -1 and end > start:
            json_str = response[start:end]
            response_dict = json.loads(json_str)
        else:
            raise json.JSONDecodeError("No JSON object found", response, 0)
    else:
        response_dict = response
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    # Fallback to conservative decision
    response_dict = {
        "action": "hold",
        "amount": 0,
        "type": "market",
        "time_in_force": "day",
        "reason": "Failed to parse LLM response"
    }
```

**Key Prompt Engineering Features:**
1. **Structured Output**: JSON format ensures consistent parsing
2. **Risk Management**: Explicit balance constraints in prompt
3. **Contextual Awareness**: Integration of account status and market data
4. **Fallback Handling**: Conservative default decisions for parsing errors
5. **Multi-factor Analysis**: Combines technical indicators with natural language reasoning

#### 3.4.2 Decision Parsing

The LLM responses are parsed to extract structured trading decisions including:
- Action (buy/sell/hold)
- Quantity

#### 4.2.2 Hyperparameter Optimization

**Hyperparameter Selection Process:**

The hyperparameters for the CNN-LSTM attention model were selected based on empirical testing and established best practices for time series forecasting with deep learning models. The following hyperparameters were evaluated and finalized:

**Core Architecture Hyperparameters:**

| Hyperparameter | Selected Value | Rationale | Alternative Values Considered |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Window Size** | 20 | Captures ~1 month of trading days, balancing pattern recognition with computational efficiency | 10, 15, 30, 60 |
| **Batch Size** | 64 | Optimal balance between training stability and memory usage on CPU | 32, 128, 256 |
| **Learning Rate** | 0.0005 | Conservative rate preventing overshooting while ensuring convergence | 0.001, 0.0001, 0.01 |
| **Dropout Rate** | 0.3 | Effective regularization without excessive information loss | 0.2, 0.4, 0.5 |
| **LSTM Units** | 64 | Sufficient capacity for pattern recognition without overfitting | 32, 128, 256 |
| **CNN Filters** | 32, 64 | Progressive feature extraction with increasing complexity | 16-32, 64-128 |
| **Kernel Size** | 3 | Captures local temporal patterns effectively | 2, 5, 7 |
| **Max Epochs** | 100 | Sufficient training time with early stopping | 50, 200, 500 |
| **Early Stopping Patience** | 10 | Prevents overfitting while allowing convergence | 5, 15, 20 |

**Optimization Algorithm Selection:**
- **Optimizer**: Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Metrics**: MAE, RMSE for comprehensive evaluation

**Hyperparameter Justification:**

1. **Window Size (20)**: Selected to capture approximately one month of trading days, providing sufficient historical context for volatility prediction while maintaining computational efficiency.

2. **Learning Rate (0.0005)**: Conservative learning rate chosen to ensure stable convergence, particularly important for financial time series with high volatility.

3. **Architecture Depth**: Two CNN layers followed by LSTM and attention mechanism provide optimal balance between model complexity and training efficiency.

4. **Regularization Strategy**: 
   - Dropout rate of 0.3 applied after CNN and dense layers
   - Early stopping with patience of 10 epochs
   - L2 regularization implicitly through Adam optimizer

**Performance Sensitivity Analysis:**

Based on empirical testing during model development:

- **Learning Rate Sensitivity**: Rates above 0.001 led to training instability; rates below 0.0001 resulted in slow convergence
- **Batch Size Impact**: Smaller batches (32) showed higher variance in training; larger batches (128+) provided marginal performance gains with increased memory usage
- **Window Size Trade-offs**: Shorter windows (10-15) captured short-term patterns but missed longer-term trends; longer windows (30+) showed diminishing returns with increased computational cost

**Hardware-Specific Optimizations:**

Given CPU-only training on Intel Core i5-13600KF:
- Batch size optimized for CPU cache efficiency
- Model size kept under 100K parameters for fast inference
- Early stopping implemented to prevent unnecessary computation

**Future Hyperparameter Optimization:**

Potential improvements could include:
- Bayesian optimization for automated hyperparameter tuning
- Multi-objective optimization balancing accuracy and inference speed
- Dynamic learning rate scheduling
- Architecture search for optimal CNN-LSTM combinations
